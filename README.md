# Machine Learning in Python

Purpose of this repo is to make short notes based on learning in Course "Machine Learning in Python" on Coursera.

## What is Machine Learning ? 
    - Study of computer programs (algorithms) that can learn by example
    - ML algorithms can generalize from existing examples of a task
        - e.g. after seeing a traning set of labeled images, 
        an image classifier can figure out how to apply labels accurately to new, 
        previously unseen images
